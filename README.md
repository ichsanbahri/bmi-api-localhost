there are some things that become the standard of security in my opinion, but certainly not all of them are safe
The quote that always reminds me is "security is inversely proportional to comfort". For application and server security, there are several things that I think are important in securing applications and servers. Human Resources and Technology, these 2 things have the most influence on application and server security.
there are several things that I often do when doing a security test in applications or servers

* Information Gathering
* Penetration Testing (white or black testing)
* Vulnerability Scan
* Server test

security must also have benefits such as
* protect data information
* anticipating cyber attacks
* managing information security risks
* improve branding
* maintain quality
